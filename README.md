# Language-converter-exercise
A simple converter for a subset of English to Morse code and vice versa. The implementation doesn't use proper markup for the morse code and delimits characters encoded with '.'

Project can be compiled to output a simple cli app that takes conversion mode, input and output files. There are most likely errors and they most likely won't be fixed.
