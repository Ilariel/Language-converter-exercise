# Language-converter-exercise
A simple converter for a subset of English to Morse code and vice versa. The implementation doesn't use proper markup for the morse code. Dits are encoded as • and dahs as − and characters are delimited with '.' Meaning encoded Morse code output/input for SOS looks like "•••.−−−.•••" 

Project can be compiled to output a simple cli app that takes conversion mode, input and output files. There are most likely errors and they most likely won't be fixed. Input files have to be UTF-8 encoded.
